Wind turbines turn wind energy into electricity. Modern wind farms often use groups of tall turbines placed in open fields or coastal regions. These turbines help reduce carbon emissions and supply clean energy to homes and industries. Engineers monitor the turbines through sensors that report rotation speed, weather conditions, and energy output.
