Rohan walked down the quiet street as the evening breeze brushed past him. He spotted an old bookshop that he had never noticed before. Its wooden sign hung a bit crooked, and a soft glow shone from inside. Curious, he stepped in and found a dusty book lying open on the counter, as if it waited for him. When he touched the page, the words shifted and formed his name, hinting that this place held something he was meant to discover.

He turned the page, and a faint shimmer rose from the paper, floating like tiny fireflies. The shop felt warmer now, almost alive, as if it breathed with him. A hidden door at the back creaked open on its own, revealing a narrow stairway leading down. Rohan hesitated for a moment, but his curiosity stayed stronger than his fear. He stepped forward, feeling that whatever waited below might change his path in ways he never expected.
